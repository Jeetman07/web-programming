    <h2>About Mount Everest</h2>
    <p>
        Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth, stands proudly in the Himalayas on the 
        border between Nepal and Tibet (China). 
        Rising to an incredible height of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level.
        It is a symbol of natural grandeur and human aspiration. 
        Known as Sagarmatha in Nepal and Chomolungma in Tibet, Everest holds deep spiritual and 
        cultural significance for the local people.
        Its breathtaking beauty lies in its towering snow-covered peak, gleaming glaciers, and 
        ever-changing skies that shift from golden hues at sunrise to deep blues by night. For 
        climbers, Mount Everest represents the ultimate challenge — a place where courage, endurance, 
        and determination are tested against the raw power of nature. Beyond its physical height, Everest 
        stands as a timeless reminder of humanity’s desire to reach the greatest heights, both literally 
        and spiritually.
